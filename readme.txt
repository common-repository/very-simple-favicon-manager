This is a very simple plugin to set a favicon and a home screen icon for your website.


== DESCRIPTION ==
= About =
This is a very simple plugin to set a favicon and a home screen icon for your website.

The favicon is a little icon that is displayed in the address bar of your browser and in your bookmark list.

The home screen icon is the shortcut icon on the home screen of mobile devices.

This plugin only supports the most common size of the iOS, Android and Windows home screen icon. This means that not all devices are covered.

= NOTICE = 
This plugin will be removed from repository. Main reasons are the new site icon feature in customizer and other more popular plugins.

You can keep using plugin, but without updates and without support from author.

= How to use =
After installation:

* Upload your favicon (.ico file) and home screen icon (.png file) in the media library
* Copy file link
* Go to Settings > Favicon Manager
* Paste file link
* Press save

= Question? =
Please take a look at the FAQ section.

= Credits =
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so: thank you!

Enjoy!


== INSTALLATION ==
Please check Description section for installation info.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I set plugin language? =
Plugin will use the site language, set in Settings > General.

If plugin isn't translated into this language, language fallback will be English.

= Are the icon sizes used in VSFM up-to-date? =
The size of the Windows icon is outdated now. So it will not support recent Windows devices.

As mentioned above I'm not planning to update plugin anymore. There was an update lately, but that only contained some necessary changes.

= What is the best file type and size for a favicon? =
For regular desktop and laptop browsers I recommend using a square multi-size .ico file that contains 3 icons with size 16x16px, 32x32px and 48x48px.

The minimum is a single 16x16px .ico file.

= What is the best file type and size for a home screen icon? =
* For iOS device I recommend using a square icon with extension .png and size 180x180px
* Android device often uses the iOS icon
* For Windows device I recommend using a square icon with extension .png and size 144x144px

This plugin only supports the most common size of the iOS, Android and Windows home screen icon. This means that not all devices are covered.

= What is a multi-size .ico file? =
An .ico file can contain multiple icons, so it can contain a 16x16px, 32x32px and 48x48px icon.

There are several free online generators available to create a multi-size .ico file.

= Can I also add a favicon with .png extension? =
Normally this is possible (although .png is less supported) but this plugin only supports a favicon with .ico extension.

= Why not use the site icon feature in customizer instead? =
With Very Simple Favicon Manager you can set a different favicon and home screen icon for your website.

So with this plugin you have more control over your favicon and home screen icon.

You should not use both because this might cause a conflict.

= How can I make a donation? =
You like my plugin and you're willing to make a donation? Nice! There's a PayPal donate link at my website.

= Other question or comment? =
Please open a topic in plugin forum.
